    <h1>China Survival Tips</h1>

    <h2>Visa</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Check visa requirements at your local Chinese embassy website or consulate. At the time of writing, citizens of Germany, Singapore, and several other countries can visit China visa-free for up to 15 days.</li>
        <li>If combining your trip with South Korea, Japan, Singapore etc., you may be eligible for a transit visa. However, be aware that flights from Wuhan to those destinations do not operate daily.</li>
        <li>For longer stays, apply for a tourist visa well in advance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessing the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Major American internet services like Gmail, YouTube, Instagram, and Google Maps are generally not accessible in China due to the "Great Firewall".</li>
        <li>Consider getting an eSIM data plan with a non-mainland Chinese number to bypass internet restrictions. Costs around $20 but you may miss some local verification SMS.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, use a reputable VPN with a local Chinese SIM, but connectivity can be unreliable. For a short trip, an eSIM is more convenient.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mobile Payment Apps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>China is largely cashless, so you need at least one mobile payment app like Alipay or WeChat Pay.</li>
        <li>For visitors, Alipay is easier to set up than WeChat Pay:
            <ul>
                <li>Link your Mastercard/Visa for payments processed as international transactions.</li>
                <li>Or apply for an Alipay Tour Pass - a virtual prepaid card from Bank of Shanghai you can top up. This is more reliable than the international transaction option.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other Useful Apps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Trip.com for booking transportation like flights, bullet trains, or accommodations etc.</li>
        <li>Gaode Maps (高德地图) is the best mapping app in China but only available in Chinese.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transportations</h2>
    <h3>Flights & bullet trains</h3>
    <p>These are the most popular and convenient ways for inter-city travel, though long-distance buses are also an option. My recommendation is to always choose G-series (Gaotie) bullet trains with first class seats over flights when the train travel time is no more than 4 hours. This is because it's actually faster when you account for the additional time needed for air travel. Bullet trains are usually slightly cheaper as well.</p>

    <h3>Didi Rideshare & Metro & Shared Bikes</h3>
    <p>For transportation within cities, using the Didi rideshare app, metro systems, and shared bikes is recommended over traditional taxis, especially due to language barriers with taxi drivers. Didi (similar to Uber) is integrated into Alipay and can be used in English, automatically translating your destination for the driver. Payment is handled seamlessly through Alipay. The metro is also an excellent affordable and efficient option in major cities. You can use metro QR-Code directly through the Alipay app or buy tickets at station. Shared bikes like Mobike and HelloBike are another convenient option for short distances. These can also be accessed and paid for through the Alipay "Transport".</p>
